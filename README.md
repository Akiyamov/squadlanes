# Squad Lanes
##### Interactive Squad Maps to help with RAAS capture point prediction

This is a work-in-progress.

Capture Points and RAAS lanes are automatically extracted from Squad maps.
Unfortunately, naming inconsistencies in the map elements and a lack of information on Unreal Engine 4's
serialized object format require some manual fixes on the automatically extracted data.
Some map layers displayed here might be incorrect.

If you spot any specific errors, please open an issue!
That helps us get an overview.

TODO: Explain how to deploy this and work on it.
