##### Interactive Squad Maps to help with RAAS capture point prediction

This is a work-in-progress.

Capture Points and RAAS lanes are automatically extracted from Squad maps.

If you spot any specific errors, please open an issue!
That helps us get an overview.

#### Usage
See [Captain's video](https://youtu.be/OFGYkDxdRYE?t=498) to find out how to work with our official deployment at [squadlanes.com](https://squadlanes.com).

#### Deployment
TODO

#### Documentation / Project overview
This project is still very much work-in-progress.
The automatic extraction method has been completely replaced since v1.0 (when the video was released) and the UI has also been completely reworked since the first prototype.
We already have tasks on our To-Do list that will likely lead to big changes in the algorithmic department of the website (Fallujah RAAS v1 / Parallel AAS).
We don't think writing documentation while the project is still this volatile is worth the effort.
If you want to contribute at this point in time, feel free to open issues and pull requests.
Just be warned, it's probably a lot of unnecessary work.
