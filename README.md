##### Interactive Squad Maps to help with RAAS capture point prediction

This is a work-in-progress.

Capture Points and RAAS lanes are automatically extracted from Squad maps.

If you spot any specific errors, please open an issue!
That helps us get an overview.

TODO: Explain how to deploy this and work on it.
