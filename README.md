##### Interactive Squad Maps to help with RAAS capture point prediction

This is a work-in-progress.

Capture Points and RAAS lanes are automatically extracted from Squad maps.

If you spot any specific errors, please open an issue!
That helps us get an overview.

#### Usage
See [Captain's video](https://youtu.be/OFGYkDxdRYE?t=498) to find out how to work with our official deployment at [squadlanes.com](https://squadlanes.com).

#### Deployment
TODO

#### Documentation / Project overview
This project is in a rather unpolished and largely undocumented state.
We apologize for this but don't have specific plans to fix this in the immediate future
since the person responsible for the extraction scripts hasn't actively played Squad in
quite a while and has moved to a kind of maintenance-only mode for this project.
If you want to contribute at this point in time, feel free to open issues and pull requests.
Just be warned, it's probably a lot of work to get into it.

- Squad map backgrounds and capture point information were extracted from game files shipped through Steam.
